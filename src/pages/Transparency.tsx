        Let's be honest...
      </p>

      <h2>Ethereum involvement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I wanted to involve ethereum in this project because it is a secure and private(relative to conventional means) way of embedding payment systems into infrastructure. The way we pay for services right now is unfit for task and is vulnerable to powerful adversaries(as we have seen with Visa and Mastercard). We, the team involved in this project and its contributors, will make money off of this, but there will be options and avenues for untaxed transactions. We are not marketing a new token or introducing a new currency or blockchain. We are not offering any speculative investment opportunities to the end user. There will be a charge on certain contracts, we are creating a revenue stream off of payment processing. There are lots of reasons to use ethereum for this over other chains: it is robust, it has a large ecosystem of technology, it has a lot of developer support, it is proof of stake. I won't expound on this point here but we I believe that evening the distribution of ethereum holdings and moving its utility away from speculative investments is ultimately a very good thing for the chain. We may decide to use different layer 2 techology for the contracts we are using down the line.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where's the money</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There will be conversations about fund distribution when the implimentation of smart contract interaction is implemented to our satisfaction. Vaguely, significant portions will be dedicated to the development and maintainance of the technologies Banyan is built on, the team involved in this project and its contributors. Some less significant portion will go to those who invested early into the project either in time or resources. Opportunities to invest monetarily in the project may or may not make themselves available, but not indefinitely if they are. Opportunities to contribute to the project and be rewarded will always be available, this is an open source project(August 2026).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is this a scam?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I'll let you decide for yourself, but I sincerely dont believe it to be.</li>
        <li>There is a lot of fraud and scams in crypto. The crypto space right now is awash with high risk speculative investments, and people treat it like an unregulated casino. I believe that just like any technological advancement, like nuclear fission or chemistry, it can be used to benefit people or benefit power. It will never benefit people if it is not seized by the people. It's nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs, chemical weapons or discoveries in medicine.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Open Source?</h2>
      <ul><li>Yes, around August of 2026.</li></ul>
